      "Consider the following scenario: You are working in the research department of a web company. You boss approaches you with a new product idea:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want a service that allows me to reveal the current topics a politician is associated with on Twitter, if this association is positive or negative and which person/company is mentioned also with this topic. For example, take the leader of your country. He/She is for sure involved in more than one public debate and i want to make these debates visible to the public. Further, I want to show how the debates polarity is and how that topic developed over time. Think of a chart that has the topic on the Y axis and the time on the X axis. Each topic is assigned a color (light colors for positiv; dark colors for negative correlation) and its width represents the quantity of discussions. If you hover over a topic, you can see the persons and companies which are also mentioned in this topic. Topics should not be limited to hash-tags only, since i want to extend this service to other services which dont contain hash-tags. Also, I am curios how hash-tags differ from real topics, since some users, like myself, rarley use a hash-tag. So could you tell me how accurate such a service will be and what its limitations are? Could we even realise it?\"\n",

      "Before leaving she turns back and says: \"Oh, i forgot. You can team up with up to 3 people from the research department and you are given 120 hours time for each of you to work on this. I won't get more budget from our investors and there are tons of other things to do. So stay in the time budget or do it in your spare time.\" \n",

Quite contrary, you have to develop a prototype that allows you to analyse the feasibility of such a service and ideally you could tell your boss (and the development department) how to implement such a service and the costs associated with it. To put it short: **your boss wants to have well justified answers, not source code**. \n",
